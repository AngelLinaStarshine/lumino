 "Early Learners (Ages 3–5)": `

At this critical developmental stage, children explore STEM through sensory play and storytelling.

**Science & Exploration**
- Hands-on experiments with water, light, and magnets
- Nature walks to observe seasonal changes

**Math Concepts**
- Counting, shapes, simple patterns
- Early number sense with manipulatives

**Technology Introduction**
- Bee-Bot robots and tablet apps
- Learning coding logic through visual games

**Literacy Integration**
- Science storytelling and themed picture books

Our Early Learners program is a joyful introduction to the world of STEM, thoughtfully designed for children ages 3 to 5. Through playful exploration, sensory-rich activities, and guided discovery, we lay the foundation for essential cognitive and motor skills. Children learn by doing — building, touching, observing, and asking questions — in a safe, nurturing environment where curiosity is celebrated and every moment sparks imagination. This is where young minds begin their lifelong learning adventure.

"Primary Learners (Ages 6–8)": `
**Overview**
Young learners build logical thinking through early math, coding, and engineering play.

**Mathematics**
- Place value, measurement, and pattern building
- Word problems and estimation

**Science & Engineering**
- States of matter, habitats, and ecosystems
- Build and test designs (bridges, towers, circuits)

**Computing**
- Early coding with ScratchJr
- Keyboarding and basic navigation skills

Our Primary Learners program is designed to spark curiosity and build foundational problem-solving skills through engaging science, math, and engineering activities. At this stage, learners begin to think critically, recognize patterns, and apply logic to real-world challenges. Hands-on experiments, interactive games, and collaborative tasks encourage exploration, teamwork, and creative thinking — all in a vibrant, supportive environment where every question leads to discovery.

**Key Components:**
- **Science Exploration:** Simple experiments using magnets, plants, and weather tools
- **Math Practice:** Building fluency in addition, subtraction, patterns, and measurements
- **Engineering Tasks:** Basic design challenges using blocks, bridges, and circuits
- **Technology Exposure:** Age-appropriate apps and early programming games
- **Literacy Connection:** Journaling, STEM-themed storybooks, and discussion prompts
